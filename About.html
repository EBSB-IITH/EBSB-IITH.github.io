    <div class="Firstpara">
        <p class="m2"> EBSB is a programme for promoting national integration through systematic exchange between paired institutes in the cultural, literary and linguistic fields. 
            We intend to learn the linguistic and cultural aspects of the home state of our paired institute, covering history,
            culture, language, cuisine, festivals, clothing etc. The EBSB club has been formed at IITH to carry forward activities under 
            the programme with our paired institute, IIT BHU. We aim to celebrate a plethora of Indian festivals and customs (paying special
            attention to those of Uttar Pradesh) in ways which are both enjoyable and informative which would thereby educate our fellow students while having fun.

              <h2 class="fk vj zp pr kk wm qb">Key Themes for Interaction</h2>
              <p class="uo">To celebrate the idea of India as a nation wherein different cultural units across varied geographies coalesce and interact with 
                each other, this glorious manifestation of diverse cuisine, music, dance, theatre, movies & films, handicrafts, sports, literature,
                festivals, painting, sculpture etc. will enable people to imbibe the innate chord of binding and brotherhood.
                To make our people aware about the seamless integral hull of the Modern Indian State spread across a vast landmass on whose firm foundations, 
                the geo-political strength of the country is ensured to benefit one and all. 
                To impress upon people at large about the increasing inter-connectedness between the constituents of various cultures and traditions, which is so vital for the spirit of nation building.
                To induce a sense of responsibility & ownership for the nation as a whole through these close cross-cultural interactions as it intends to build up the inter-dependence.</p>
